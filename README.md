Yo! Here's the Deal:
This program is totally free for you to use, share, and tweak however you want, under the GNU General Public License, Version 3 (or later, if that works for you).

Quick note: We mainly built this for NFTs, but since the program works with a lot of different data, we figured, why not share it so everyone can use it? That said, there are a few parts we’re not making public for security reasons—gotta protect our data, you know?

Also, just so you know: I’m not planning to build an exchange or anything like that. If you want to trade, go check out the AYIN website. This is meant to be used on your own computer, no need for any external websites. There might be some limited features down the road, but for now, it’s all good.

We’re sharing this code to help you out, but just to be clear: no promises, no guarantees, no warranties. If something breaks or doesn’t work how you expected, that’s on you. So, don’t come back blaming us if things go wrong.

By using this, you agree to keep the code open and free. If you modify it or share it, make sure you stick with the same license and give credit where it’s due. Sharing is caring, right?
